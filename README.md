# Pygame GUI Examples
A few simple programs to demonstrate how to use features of the [pygame_gui](https://github.com/MyreMylar/pygame_gui) module.

To run these programs you must first have installed the [pygame_gui](https://github.com/MyreMylar/pygame_gui) project (which itself depends on pygame-ce). 

It's also worth noting that [pygame_gui](https://github.com/MyreMylar/pygame_gui) is designed to work with pygame-ce.
